            <p class="stratumText20">Diller Scofidio + Renfro (DS+R) is an interdisciplinary design studio that works at the intersection of architecture, the visual arts, and the performing arts. Founded in 1981, the New York-based studio established its identity through independent, conceptual, and self-generated art and architecture installations before reaching international prominence with large cultural and civic projects such as Blur Building at the 2002 Swiss Expo; the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston; the redevelopment of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts in New York; and the High Line in New York. Today, DS+R is led by four partners—Elizabeth Diller, Ricardo Scofidio, Charles Renfro and Benjamin Gilmartin—who work collaboratively with a staff of over 100 architects, designers, artists, and researchers</p>
